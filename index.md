# Bluetooth Zoom/OBS Controller
My device allows one to wirelessly control and use Zoom. The device can do shortcuts such as: muting mic, video on/off, screen sharing, and many more.

# Project Demo
During my project demo, I show my project and how it works from the user's point of view.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the modifications for my project. The modifications that I made was to change what each button did. As some of the buttons wouldn't be very useful in a real zoom meeting. To accomplish this, I had to find the portion of the code where the commands were being pressed. I then had to change the commands according to the shortcut buttons on Zoom.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was completing the code and testing the product. After I had completed the code, I had to download a few libraries to make sure that the proper necessities were in place. Afterwards, I tried to test the project. However, it didn't work as there was some error with the wiring and/or the code. I tried to rewire and redo the code, but eventually, I realized that the code was written for the device to be connected wirelessly, whereas I was just trying to plug it in. After connecting the device to bluetooth, I was able to get it working.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was completing the wiring for the circuit. I had to use breadboards instead of soldering the rainbow cables directly to the chip as I was unable to unsolder the pins. I also didn't have the right resistors, so I had to place resistors in parallel and resistors in series to increase and decrease the resistance.
