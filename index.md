# Bluetooth Zoom/OBS Controller
My device allows one to wirelessly control and use Zoom. The device can do shortcuts such as: muting mic, video on/off, screen sharing, and many more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was completing the wiring for the circuit. I had to use breadboards instead of soldering the rainbow cables directly to the chip as I was unable to unsolder the pins. I also didn't have the right resistors, so I had to place resistors in parallel and resistors in series to increase and decrease the resistance.
